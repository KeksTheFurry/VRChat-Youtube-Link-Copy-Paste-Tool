# VRChat Youtube Link CopyPaste Tool
A simple tool that allows you to copy-paste youtube links into VRChat without leaving VR. Best to use together with fpsVR utilities (Steam Store App).

Recommended use-case:
1. Have fpsVR installed ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/908520/fpsVR/ ) (optional, but highly recommended!)
2. Run this program before starting VR (optional: Already put Youtube links into the program)
3. Play VRChat and click on an URL input box from within VRChat
4. Klick the SteamVR button on your controller and click on desktop to see your computer screen
5. Point at the fpsVR ovverlay on your controller while SteamVR menu is still open and click on "utilities"
6. Click on the buttons on the fpsVR overlay:
- CTRL+SHIFT+1 to open youtube where you can search a video (if you already have youtube open in a browser, it will show this)
- CTRL+SHIFT+2 to open this tool for using the already entered links (The POST button forwards the link to VRCHAT)
- CTRL+SHIFT+3 to auto-post the youtube link into VRCHAT which works as described:
  1. After pressing, the current youtube tab receives focus. Now click on the URL to select it completely within 5 seconds.
  2. The Application switches to VRChat and enters the link into the previously selected input box

Please note: The point of this program is that you don't have to take of your headset at all to perform all of that. fpsVR is needed for people with only one screen and/or for convenience, but you can also use the user interface of the program instead if you have a second monitor. If you need a keyboard to search things on youtube, there is a button on your controller to open one while being in the steamVR menu desktop screen.

The program opens youtube itself if it can't find an open window handle with "Youtube" in it, so you don't need to have a browser open when playing VR. Also has a youtube button and a hint to which shortcuts can be used in fpsVR on the bottom. It can also handle windows that are not maximized.
